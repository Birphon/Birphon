# Hi, I'm Jared! üëã


## üöÄ About Me
I'm a graduate of Ara Institue of Canterbury with a Bachelors of Information Communication Technologies in Software Developemnt. I am currently working as a Part Time Worker in a supermarket while on the hunt for full time work

# Schooling

As mentioned I have graduated with a BICT in software development, however the files of my work that I personal held have been corrupted and I have been in the process of attempting to obtain it from Ara however this is a lengthy process.

Within Ara however I have worked on three 'major' projects:

- TechColab Website


This project was held within a class and was done as an taster of the Capstone Project. This project was to work on a website for the TechColab, a student-powered social enterprise providing affordable business & tech services to small-medium enterprise

While this project was enjoyable to work on and helped for the following semesters Capstone project, the overall outcome was disatisfactory (for myself) and was not used as a final product.

- Virtual Emerge Tour


Along the same vein as TechColab, this was a project to work on a Virtual Emerge Tour for the Emerge Expo that Ara holds to showcase Capstone Projects. There were many difficulties with using the program given with no real alternatives resulting in an uncomplete project

- Capstone Project - Cello communications application


This project was working with Cello (https://cello.co.nz/) to work on an in house communications and rostering application to avoid double bookings of staff members to projects and to enable communication between staff without needing to bounce between department members before you find a free person.

This project was using a lot of Microsoft Power Platform, primarily Power Automate, SharePoint and Power Apps to name a few.

This project again was very enjoyable, though was very much a "Conceptual" Project to see if the company wished to further proceed with the project in making an official application. This project, again, was not meet to personal standards resulting in a disatisfactory outcome.
